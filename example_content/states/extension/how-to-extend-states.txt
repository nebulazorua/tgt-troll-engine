// This is only available for global content folders (either contents/global or a mod marked as global in its metadata.json)
// To use you have to add a script to the states/extension directory with the same name as the class of the state you want to extend

// For example, to extend TitleState you'll need to make a script called "TitleState.hscript" on "states/extension/"
// The script code should be structured like this.

/* SCRIPT START
function create(){
    // anything to be done before the state create code
    statecreate();
    // anything after
}

function update(elapsed:Float){
    // before state update
    stateupdate(elapsed);
    // after state update
}
*/ SCRIPT END

// statecreate/stateupdate can be replaced with super.create or super.update, if you dont want the code from the original state to be ran
// they can also only be called in the relevant function, so you cant call stateupdate in create or statecreate in update

// By default you can only extend the following MusicBeatState functions
/*
	"create"
	"update"
	"destroy"
	"openSubState"
	"closeSubState"
	"stepHit"
	"beatHit"
	"sectionHit"
*/

// this is all a heavy WIP
